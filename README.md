# JS30 Deployed
JavaScript30 is a set of 30 Vanilla JS projects curated by [Wesbos](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30). The projects are meant to be completed within a day. Below you can find all my entries for the challenge. My solutions have updated syntax compared to the original solutions. My solutions are also written to work alongside Vite and have been deployed to GitHub Pages. Some projects are only compatible with desktop (for now). Some projects do not have a deployment link because the central task did not involve creating a website.
